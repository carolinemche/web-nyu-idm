# Object Meditation: My Mochi Keychain

### What are 5 words that come to mind when I think of this object
- friendship
- memories
- mochi
- best friends
- Simba

### Are there special places this object is associated with?
- this keychain is associated with my two best friends, Arya and Nicole.

### What does my object look like?
- It is a small keychain that is in the shape of a dango (japanese mochi balls).
There are three orange balls skewered ontop of a stick.

### Feel like?
- it feels smooth and I think it is made out of wood.

### Smell like?
- it does not have any distinct smell to it

### Where did you get it?
- I got it from my friend Nicole. She got in in Tokyo, Japan while out shopping
in the Harajuku district.

### What are the emotions attached to this object for you?
- emotions that I get from this object are warmth and platonic love

### Why did you choose it?
- I choose it because Arya and Nicole were my best friends throughout high school
and middle school. We were unseparable (and still are) and always do everything
together. The keychain symbolizes our friendship and the idea of always being
together, like we are a package deal (three mochis on a stick). We all went to
separate colleges, but still talk everyday but its not the same. The keychain also
just simply reminds us of our friendships.

### Is it one of a kind?
- Yes, but we each have one of a different color. I have an orange one, Arya has
a green one, and Nicole has a pink one.

### How do you interact with it?
- I hang it on my backpack and use it as an acessory.

### What are some other objects it does or might have relationships with?
- The keychain doesnt have any relationships that I can think of.

### What is a specific memory you have with this object?
- One of my most specific memories was when I recieved the object from Nicole about four years ago. It was the first summer where we were all travelling and away from home for most of the summer. We didn't get to see each other for three months and
because of time zone differences, we didn't talk that much either. We all got
together and had gifts and souvenirs for each other from the places we travelled
but the keychain was so special and our favorite because it had so much meaning
behind it.
